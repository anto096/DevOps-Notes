CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It's a set of practices and principles that aim to automate the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.

Continuous Integration (CI):

Integration: The practice of frequently merging code changes from multiple contributors into a central repository.
Automation: Automated testing and build processes are integral parts of CI.
Goal: Detect integration errors as quickly as possible and provide rapid feedback to developers.
Continuous Deployment (CD):

Deployment: The process of automatically deploying every code change that passes the automated tests to production.
Automation: Includes not only deployment but also infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
Goal: Ensure that software is always deployable and that deployments are reliable and repeatable.
Key Practices:

Version Control: Using a version control system (like Git) to manage code changes.
Automated Builds: Automatically building and testing code changes whenever a change is committed to version control.
Automated Testing: Running automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) to ensure that changes don't break existing functionality.
Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploying applications to production environments after passing through all stages of testing.
Infrastructure as Code: Managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation tools.
Benefits:

Faster Time to Market: Rapid feedback and automated processes reduce the time between code changes and production deployments.
Improved Quality: Automated testing helps catch bugs early, reducing the likelihood of bugs reaching production.
Consistency: Automated processes ensure that deployments are consistent and predictable.
Collaboration: Encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and operations teams by providing a common framework and visibility into the software delivery pipeline.
CI/CD pipelines are foundational to modern software development practices, enabling teams to deliver software more efficiently, reliably, and frequently.
