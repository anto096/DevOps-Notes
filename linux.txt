Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.

Open-Source:
Open-source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. By design, open-source software licenses promote collaboration and sharing because they permit other people to make modifications to source code and incorporate those changes into their own projects. They encourage computer programmers to access, view, and modify open-source software whenever they like, as long as they let others do the same when they share their work.

History of Linux:

	Linus Torvalds identified few issues in Unix.
	Linus Torvalds started developing his own Operating System by using 'Minux' OS
(Li)nus Toravalds   + Mi(nux)  ==> Linux OS

	Linus Torvalds released Linux OS for free of cost.
	Linux Torvalds provided Linux OS source code also in the internet	
	People and companies downloaded source code of Linux OS and they modified according to their requirement and released into market with their brand names
	As companies released their own Linux OS we can see several distributions for Linux OS

	Ex:
1.	Ubuntu
2.	CentOS
3.	RedHat
4.	Fedora
5.	SUSE
6.	KALI 
7.	Debian etc....

Note: There are 200+ Linux Distributions available in the market

Architecture:
The architecture of a Linux System consists of the following layers –
•	Hardware layer − Hardware consists of all peripheral devices (RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc).
•	Kernel − It is the core component of Operating System, interacts directly with hardware, provides low level services to upper layer components.
•	Shell − an interface to kernel, hiding complexity of kernel's functions from users. The shell takes commands from the user and executes kernel's functions.
•	Applications/ Utilities – Applications/Utility programs that provide the user most of the functionalities of an operating systems.

 

Features of Linux:
Following are some of the important features of Linux Operating System.
•	Portable − Portability means software can works on different types of hardware in same way. Linux kernel and application programs supports their installation on any kind of hardware platform.
•	Open Source − Linux source code is freely available and it is community-based development project. Multiple teams work in collaboration to enhance the capability of Linux operating system and it is continuously evolving.
•	Multi-User − Linux is a multiuser system means multiple users can access system resources like memory/ ram/ application programs at same time.
•	Multiprogramming − Linux is a multiprogramming system means multiple applications can run at same time.
•	Hierarchical File System − Linux provides a standard file structure in which system files/ user files are arranged.
•	Shell − Linux provides a special interpreter program which can be used to execute commands of the operating system. It can be used to do various types of operations, call application programs. etc.
•	Security − Linux provides user security using authentication features like password protection/ controlled access to specific files/ encryption of data.
