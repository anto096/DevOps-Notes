APACHE MAVEN

	Maven is a free and open source software given by Apache Organization.
	Maven is called as Java Build Tool.
	Maven is used to perform Build Automation for java projects.
	Note: Maven is used as a build tool for only java projects.


Why Maven?

1) We can create initial project folder structure using maven.
2) We can download "project dependencies" using maven
    (ex : spring boot, hibernate, kafka, redis, email, log4j, junit, security...)

•	To develop one java project we will use several frameworks like spring, hibernate.
•	We need to download those frameworks and we should add to our java project.
•	These frameworks we are using in our project are called as our project dependencies
•	Instead of we are downloading dependencies, we can tell to maven software to download dependencies.
•	Note: Required dependencies we will add in "pom.xml" file then maven will download them.
•	pom stands for project object model.
•	When we create maven project then pom.xml file will be created automatically
•	pom.xml will act as input file for maven software

3) We can compile project source code using maven.
4) We can package java project as jar or war file using maven.

	Java program files will have .java as extension
o	Ex: Demo.java, Hello.java, Driver.java, Calculator.java etc.
	Java Programs (.java file) contains source code, we can't execute .java files directly
	We need to compile java source code into byte code using java compiler (javac)
o	Ex: javac Demo.java
	When we compile java code it will create .class file
	We need to execute .class file to run the java program
o	Ex: java Demo
	When we run java program using java command, JVM will start and it will execute java program
	Note: JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine
	When we compile project source code we will get .class files
	To deploy java project, we will package all .class files as JAR file or WAR file
o	JAR : Java Archive	
o	WAR : Web Archive
	Standalone java projects will be packaged as a JAR file
	Note: Standalone applications means the project which runs only in one computer
o	Ex: notepad, calculator....
	Web Applications will be packaged as WAR file
	Note: Multiple users can access web applications at a time
o	Ex: gmail, facebook, flipkart, naukri etc....


MAVEN GOALS:
To perform project build activities maven provided several goals for us.
clean: clean goal is used to delete target folder
compile: compile goal is used to compile project source code. Compiled code will be stored in target folder ( convert .java to .class)
test:  test goal is used to execute unit test code of our application (JUnit code)
package: package goal is used to generate jar or war file for our application based on packaging type available in pom.xml file. Jar or War file will be created in target folder.
install: install goal is used to install our project as a dependency in maven local repository.
