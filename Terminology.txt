Server Environments

1. Development Environment: The development environment is where developers write and test their code, and create new features for the application. This environment is typically hosted on local machines or a dedicated development server.

2. Test Environment: The test environment is used to validate the functionality and quality of the application before it is deployed to production. It mimics the production environment as closely as possible and can be hosted on dedicated servers or virtual machines.

3. Staging Environment: The staging environment is a replica of the production environment and is used to test the application in a production-like environment before it is released to production.

4. Production Environment: The production environment is where the application is deployed and made available to end-users. It is critical that the production environment is stable, secure, and highly available to ensure the application is always accessible.

Server Types / Categories 
1. Web Server: A web server is used to host websites and web applications. It receives and processes HTTP requests from clients and sends back the corresponding HTML pages or other web resources.

2. Application Server: An application server is used to host and run business applications, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, and other applications.

3. Database Server: A database server is used to host databases and store data. It provides access to the stored data to client applications.

4. Mail Server: A mail server is used to host and manage email accounts for an organization. It receives and sends email messages to and from clients and other mail servers.

5. File Server: A file server is used to host and manage files and folders that are shared within an organization. It enables users to store, access, and share files and documents.

6. Print Server: A print server is used to manage and control printing tasks within an organization. It enables users to print documents and manage print jobs from a central location.

7. DNS Server: A DNS server is used to translate domain names into IP addresses. It provides a way for clients to locate and connect to servers and other network devices using friendly domain names.

8. Proxy Server: A proxy server is used to provide security, privacy, and performance improvements for client requests. It acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, intercepting and processing requests on behalf of the clients.

9. Backup Server: A backup server is used to store and manage backups of important data and applications. It provides a way to recover data in case of data loss or system failure.

Testing Types

1. Unit Testing: It is the process of testing individual units or components of the software to ensure that they work as expected. It is usually done by developers during the development phase.

2. Integration Testing: It is the process of testing the integration of different components of the software to ensure that they work together as expected. It is usually done after unit testing.

3. System Testing: It is the process of testing the entire software system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. It is usually done after integration testing. System testing can involve various types of tests such as functional testing, performance testing, security testing, usability testing, and compatibility testing.

4. Acceptance Testing: It is the process of testing the software by end-users or customers to ensure that it meets their requirements and is fit for purpose. It is usually done after system testing.

5. Regression Testing: It is the process of testing the software after making changes or updates to ensure that the existing functionality is not impacted and no new issues are introduced.

6. Performance Testing: It is the process of testing the software to ensure that it performs well under various loads and conditions.

7. Security Testing: It is the process of testing the software to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious users or hackers.

8. Usability Testing: It is the process of testing the software to ensure that it is easy to use and understand by end-users.

10. Compatibility Testing: It is the process of testing the software to ensure that it works as expected on different platforms, browsers, and devices.
